# How does salt influence micobial communities?

Question:
1.  How is do microbial biodiversity modified across a salinity gradient?
	- Nill hypothesis: Microbial Biodiversity (e.g richness) does not vary along the salinity gradient.
	- Hypothesis: Microbial richness will increase as salt concentration lowers. 
		- There is an inverse relationship between richness and salinity
2. How does microbial composition change across a salinity gradient?
	- Null hypothesis: Microbial composition does not change across a salinity gradient.
	- Hypothesis: Dominant members of the microbial communities are unique in freshwater compared to salt water.
